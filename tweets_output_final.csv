@AskPerplexity,"Gold prices in India have recently hit record highs, and their future movement depends on several factors like global economic trends, interest rates, and demand patterns. While some forecasts suggest a potential decline in gold prices later in 2025 due to a stronger US dollar and reduced demand, others highlight continued geopolitical uncertainties and inflation concerns that could sustain or even increase prices in the short term.  If you're considering buying gold now, it might be worth waiting for potential price corrections in the coming months, but this depends on your investment horizon and risk tolerance. For long-term investors, gold remains a strong hedge against economic instability, so any dip could be an opportunity to accumulate.","Mar 20, 2025 · 3:05 PM UTC",0.9253,0,0,0,0

@julianHjessop,"Bank of England holds tight in a fog of uncertainty  My quick take... 🤔  (TL;DR - The Bank does not have much of a clue about what happens next either!)  The Bank of England’s decision to leave UK interest rates on hold this week was widely expected and consistent with the MPC’s “gradual and careful approach”. There can be good times to surprise the markets, but this probably was not one of them.  The MPC, like most businesses, investors, and households, is grappling with multiple uncertainties both at home and abroad. The big unknowns include the continuing fallout from last October’s Budget and from President Trump’s tariff wars, as well as what the Chancellor will announce next week.  The MPC’s dilemma is whether to pay more attention to the downside risks to growth or the upside risks to inflation. The MPC can and should be willing to look past a temporary increase in inflation if underlying price pressures are easing. Moreover, growth in money and credit remains subdued, and interest rates are still above a ‘neutral’ level. As such, there was a strong case for a further cut today.  Nonetheless, it would be harsh to criticise the majority on the MPC for opting to wait for the Bank’s next economic forecasts in May. But a cut then is still not guaranteed, especially as most of the key April data will not be available until after the meeting.  In the meantime, anyone looking for a confidence boost from today’s announcement was almost bound to be disappointed.","Mar 20, 2025 · 12:52 PM UTC",0.5334,20,6,0,0

@Trail2C46500,"💰We're all talkin about the FED and rates. And I am getting questions what it is all about❓️  What might be nice anyway is a super simple explanation about those FED interest rates.  It’s not directly about the interest rates on your loan or mortgage, but about what banks charge each other when they borrow money.  Every bank is required to keep a mandatory reserve at the FED, a sort of emergency fund. If there’s a bank run or something, there’s cash available. If a bank needs more than it has on hand, it borrows from another bank (from that reserve at the FED) at the interest rate set by the FED.  Why is that important? Banks often use that interest rate as a guideline for mortgages and other loans. They don’t have to, but in practice, they do. A lower interest rate makes borrowing cheaper, which gives the economy a boost.  But why would you ever raise that interest rate? To keep things from getting out of hand. The FED tries to prevent ‘bubbles’ and an overheated economy. If everything goes too fast, it can crash hard.  Thought it might be nice to understand what it’s all about!🫡","Mar 20, 2025 · 2:53 PM UTC",0.986,2,0,1,0

The Yen with the lowest Interest rate out off the currencies in the G-7.   One problem for Ueda is inflation running at 3% when rates are just 50bps.   Ueda made clear that the landscape will become more clear in April where we will see the effects off the Tariffs.  The FED Is expected too cut rates twice this year still maintaing the large gap in rates. Japans trade minster failed to to win an immediate exemption from Trumps tariffs plans ‘We have requested that Japan should not be the subject of such tariffs measures that the U.S Government has announced so far’ Japan trade minister   Overall i still do not Buy the Yen strength, their is underlying problems in that country and rate hikes possibly on the card later all the big players are still short Yen.  FOMC  Stocks climbed and bond yields fell as Powell gave investors some clarity regarding tariffs ( the word i think everyone is getting sick off 😂👀) the common consensus was correct in that rates would be held, but as soon as he said the word “Transitory”. Stocks rallied biggest day since July after a painful four weeks for investors.  Yields also fell anticipating 2 rate cuts later in the year, Last week i called a potential position on ZN futures (T-Note futures) in which i was interested in the Government bonds especially the 10 year drawing lower ( This is the benchmark for U.S Interest rates) ZN rallied on the news so we will see in the coming weeks what transpired.

@robbie_jeo,"🚨 FOMC Update - March 19, 2025:  The Fed’s Decision and What It Means!   The Federal Reserve (The Fed) just made some key decisions that could have big impacts on the economy and financial markets.  Here’s what you need to know! 👇   📉 Interest Rates remain at 4.25% - 4.50%. The Fed decided not to cut rates despite ongoing economic uncertainty. No urgency to lower rates right now. The Fed is staying cautious.   🔒 Balance Sheet Reduction (QT) will slow down starting April 2025. - The Fed will cut Treasury holdings from $25 billion to $5 billion per month. - Mortgage-backed securities will still be reduced by $35 billion per month. This means QT is starting to wrap up, and liquidity in the market will stay around longer.   📊 Inflation is still a bit high, but The Fed remains committed to the 2% target. - The Fed will continue to monitor economic data closely before making any further moves. - Inflation is still a key concern.   💼 The U.S. economy is still stable, and unemployment remains steady. - The labor market is still strong, and there’s no sign of a major recession anytime soon. - This is a positive sign for the economy, although challenges remain.   ❌ Christopher Waller disagrees with the Fed’s decision to slow down the balance sheet reduction. - He wants to keep QT aggressive to bring down inflation faster. - This highlights some internal disagreement within the FOMC.   ⚠️ Trump has room to escalate the tariff war. - With looser monetary policy, Trump could get more aggressive with tariffs, which could affect global trade.  Conclusion: The Fed is taking a cautious approach, but isn’t ready to cut rates anytime soon.

Policy Adjustments & Market Reactions • Fed will slow balance sheet reduction starting in April, cutting the pace of Treasury runoff from $25B to $5B per month. • Economic uncertainty is rising due to: • Deregulation efforts by the Trump administration. • Tariff increases impacting trade and costs. • Federal job cuts dampening consumer sentiment. • Loan demand has softened, with businesses hesitating on major financial decisions. • Stock markets reacted negatively to the mixed economic signals.  What’s Next for Interest Rates? • Fewer Fed officials expect rate cuts this year: 11 out of 19 now project at least two reductions, down from 15 in December. • Fed Chair Jerome Powell reaffirmed a cautious approach, stating the central bank will continue to evaluate economic conditions before making adjustments.  #FederalReserve #InterestRates #Inflation #GDP #EconomicGrowth #JeromePowell #StockMarket #Tariffs #MonetaryPolicy #Finance","Mar 20, 2025 · 2:34 PM UTC",0.2263,0,0,0,0

@TheTrue2,"Can the executive branch of government force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates?  No, the executive branch of the U.S. government cannot directly force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Here's why:  Federal Reserve Independence:  The Federal Reserve (the Fed) is designed to be an independent entity within the U.S. government. This independence is crucial for the Fed to make monetary policy decisions based on economic data, rather than political pressure. Congress established the Federal Reserve as an independent entity. Separation of Powers:  The U.S. system of government is based on the separation of powers, with distinct roles for the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Monetary policy falls under the Fed's purview, not the executive branch's. What the Executive Branch Can Do:  Public Statements: The President and other executive branch officials can publicly express their views on interest rates and the Fed's policies. These statements can exert some degree of influence, but they do not constitute direct control.  Appointments: The President appoints the Chair and members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, subject to Senate confirmation. These appointments can influence the Fed's overall direction, but individual appointees are expected to act independently.  Economic Policy: The executive branch's fiscal policies (e.g., taxes, spending) can indirectly influence the Fed's decisions. For example, if the executive branch pursues policies that stimulate the economy, the Fed might raise interest rates to prevent inflation.  Why Independence Matters: Fed independence is intended to prevent political interference in monetary policy. This helps to ensure that interest rate decisions are based on sound economic principles, rather than short-term political considerations. This independence helps to maintain the credibility of the U.S. dollar and financial system. In summary: While the executive branch can express its opinions and indirectly influence the Fed, it cannot directly force the Fed to cut interest rates. The Fed's independence is a cornerstone of U.S. monetary policy.","Mar 20, 2025 · 2:32 PM UTC",0.9782,0,0,0,0

@portal_fxco,"USD/JPY. Analysis and Forecast  The Japanese yen maintains its bullish bias, driven by expectations that the Bank of Japan will continue raising interest rates this year.  A strong increase in wages could boost consumer spending, which, in turn, would support inflation and provide the Bank of Japan with room to further tighten its monetary policy.  Despite this, uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy under President Donald Trump and geopolitical risks continue to reinforce the yen's status as a safe-haven asset, leading to an intraday decline in USD/JPY towards the 148.00 level. However, moderate strength in the U.S. dollar is limiting further losses. Additionally, expectations of multiple rate cuts by the Fed this year could cap the dollar's upside, thus restraining the pair's potential gains.  Technical Outlook From a technical perspective, USD/JPY's failure to sustain gains above the psychological 150.00 level, followed by a subsequent decline, suggests that the recent rebound from a multi-month low has lost momentum.  Bearish oscillators on the daily chart support the likelihood of further downside. A break below 148.00 could open the door to the next support level near 147.70, with the downward move possibly extending toward 147.30, the 147.00 round figure, and the 146.55–146.50 zone, which marks the lowest level since early October.  On the other hand, any recovery attempts could face resistance around the Asian session high near 149.00. A supply zone exists between 149.25 and 149.30, above which USD/JPY may attempt a return to the 150.00 psychological level.  A break above yesterday's high at 150.15 could trigger a short-covering rally, driving prices toward the intermediate resistance at 150.60, followed by 151.00 and the monthly high near 151.30.

@SlavFreeSpirit,"~However, the prolonged era of high interest rates, which now seems likely, may lead to a surge in debt-serving costs and restrict public funding possibilities, especially if combined with a significant increase in defense spending,"" Bloomberg observes.  According to Christopher Smart, a former high-ranking economic policy official of the US Treasury Department and the White House, if EU governments avoid making ""politically difficult decisions,"" it can only ensure the preservation of high borrowing costs.  ""We live in a world of politicians who prefer guns and oil,"" Smart said. ""So, I don't know if that's going to make a lot of hard choices, it's just going to lead to more debt, which in itself will lead to higher rates."" ""  The speech by the European Commissioner for Financial Services and Investment, Maria Luis Albuquerque, says European Union leaders have decided to make a ""politically difficult decision"" - to rob their citizens.  However, the protest against the EU rearmament course at any cost has already emerged.  The Dutch parliament just voted against the plan to rearm Europe, rejecting Brussels' militarist plans.  ""Dutch parliament votes against Europe's rearmament plan - the majority of Dutch parliaments voted against state participation in the European Commission's proposal for a plan for Europe's rearming,"" reports the independent French portal Observateur Continental.  Three of the four parties of the Dutch government voted on the proposal against the plans of Prime Minister Schuff, who had previously pledged to cooperate with the European Defense Project.  ""The Dutch parties voted mainly against the European rearmament plan, because the European Commission announces that countries can abandon tax rules. They are worried that the public debt could increase quickly. Furthermore, they do not want European countries to take out joint loans to increase the defense budget. “There would be an additional risk that countries could pay off other people’s debts,” the post noted.  ""Brussels' military economic path foresees the realization of huge savings at the expense of employees, workers, retirees, unemployed and medical institutions. Brussels is considering the possibility of sacrificing the population,"" points out the Observateur Continental.  This cruel reality was already realized in Netherlands. There is no doubt that the maturing groups of popular anger will make Brussels bureaucrats, who are ready to sacrifice their own people to the Moloch of war, sober up.","Mar 20, 2025 · 6:07 AM UTC",-0.8362,3,1,1,0

@swaminathankp,"“Fed's Sub-2% Growth Forecast: Strategic Implications for India's Export Sectors”  The US Federal Reserve concluded its FOMC meeting yesterday, maintaining interest rates at the 4.25%-4.50% range. However, the crucial detail that demands our attention isn't the unchanged rates but rather the Fed's significantly reduced GDP growth projections for the next three years - uncharacteristically falling below the 2% threshold that has long served as a baseline for healthy US economic expansion.  The Fed's latest economic projections paint a sobering picture: US GDP growth is expected to decelerate to just 1.7% in 2025, followed by sub-2% growth through 2027. This represents a stark decrease from the 2.8% growth achieved in 2024 and 2.9% in 2023. To put this in perspective, the US economy has maintained growth consistently around the 2.5% range for well over a decade.  Based on GDP data since 1961, the US economy has never experienced three consecutive years with sub-2% growth – yet now the Fed anticipates precisely this scenario through 2027.  While US markets have responded positively to the Fed's announcements, this optimism stems primarily from the maintained projection of two rate cuts this year, potentially totaling 50 basis points. This monetary easing would build upon the 100 basis points of cuts already implemented over the past six months, creating a more accommodative financial environment.  Essentially, the market is interpreting ""bad news"" (lower growth) as ""good news"" (lower interest rates and potentially fewer trade barriers).  The Stagflation Specter  The key takeaway is that the decreased growth forecast is likely to discourage aggressive reciprocal tariffs from the US government. Although US inflation has cooled in recent months, imposing high tariffs would risk boosting consumer prices further, creating a dangerous combination of low growth and high inflation – a scenario known as stagflation. Stagflation is often a precursor to a prolonged economic downturn, and potentially even a recession.  It wouldn’t be right to consider positive market reactions as creating favorable conditions for aggressive trade reforms. Rather, markets are anticipating a more measured, cautious approach to US trade policy given the challenging growth outlook ahead.  Indian Export Sectors Poised to Gain  What does this mean for Indian markets? Sectors that have established significant export relationships with the US and demonstrated robust growth trajectories stand particularly well-positioned. These include electronics, auto components, petroleum products, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices.  The slowing US growth, coupled with a potentially more cautious approach to trade restrictions, could create a more favorable environment for these Indian sectors to expand their US market share.  #GlobalTrade #Exports #USFedMeeting #fomc #GDPGrowth #Stagflation #InterestRates #Electronics #Automobile #Pharma #Chemicals #GlobalEconomy #StockMarket #MarketUpdates   *Also see https://nitter.privacyredirect.com/swaminathankp/status/1894002584417099883","Mar 20, 2025 · 11:53 AM UTC",0.9973,37,3,0,0

@GarrisonFathom,"Uncle Sam isn't the only government that can't seem to get its finances under control: interest rates are swallowing the largest portion of economic output since at least 2007, outstripping spending on defense and housing.  This is a potentially catastrophic house of cards: at this rate the world's richest nations will need to decide whether to pare back spending to meet debt obligations (the responsible choice), issue new debt to cover obligations and make the situation even worse (the likely choice), or face default.  The global financial system runs on debt, and while there's nothing inherently ""wrong"" with that - debt is just a tool, after all, no different than any other - what matters is how that debt is used (invested into projects that grow GDP) and managed (fiscal and monetary policy). The inflation ignited by covid stimulus, and the persistence allowed by tepid rate policies, have painted the world's richest countries into a corner, which begs the question:  What happens when nobody wants to buy government debt anymore?","Mar 20, 2025 · 2:01 PM UTC",-0.7388,1,0,0,0
